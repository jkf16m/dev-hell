# How to install and run the project


## Backend

The backend side of the project, is made using python, poetry and fastAPI.

Start by installing python, the last version of python.


Then, install poetry. You can follow the official installation guide for
poetry.
Or simply run the following command, if it doesn't work, refer
to the official poetry documentation:
`pipx install poetry`

Now, inside the folder "backend" of this project,
run:

`poetry env activate`
This will output a small command, you must copy it and execute it:

source {long path to an environment activator}

After running this command, finally you can execute:
`poetry install`
